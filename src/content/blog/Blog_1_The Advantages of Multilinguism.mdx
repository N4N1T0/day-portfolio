title: 'The Advantages of Multilinguism'
excerpt: 'In recent years, people have relied more extensively than ever on Machine Translation and automatic Speech Translation to understand content in languages unknown to them, largely due to advancements in technology. One of the most notable changes has been the growing use of AI for language-related tasks. Many people ask themselves: Will AI substitute language studies? Is it really necessary to even learn a new language nowadays?'

As a language student back in 2012, I was reassured that technology was not going to replace translators and interpreters. There was no way machines could connect ideas like the human brain does. Little did we know that just a year later, neural machine translation (NMT) would begin revolutionizing the language industry. In 2018, Microsoft researchers boldly claimed that human-machine parity in translation had been achieved. Of course, they were referring to a specific language pair and set of texts. Nonetheless, they brought massive attention to the capabilities of these engines and the possibility of integrating them into a translator's workflow. For many, this was a welcome change, while for others it was seen as an atrocious crime against our profession.

More recently, 2022 marked a definitive revolution in the language industry, with artificial intelligence (AI) incorporating millions of data points into the training of NMT engines, making them "smarter."

People have learned to work with these systems for countless tasks, including translation and interpreting. A new field of study called prompt engineering has emerged, and most people now travel the world with ChatGPT or the Google Translate app on their phones, allowing them to communicate with almost anyone in hundreds of different languages. However, there are still tasks that only humans can perform. Let’s dive into the capabilities and limitations of NMT and AI in serving language-related tasks.

## Capabilities of NMT and AI in Language Tasks:

1. **Speed and Efficiency:** NMT can process vast amounts of text in a fraction of the time it would take a human translator. Whether it's translating documents, websites, or real-time speech, AI-driven systems like Google Translate or DeepL make rapid translation possible with just a few clicks.

2. **Handling Multiple Languages:** AI translation tools support hundreds of languages, making them indispensable for global communication. A single app can handle dozens of language pairs, providing a level of accessibility that was unthinkable just a decade ago.

3. **Constant Learning and Improvement:** Thanks to machine learning, NMT systems continuously learn from new data. This means that over time, they adapt and improve, refining their ability to understand nuances, idiomatic expressions, and even specialized jargon.

4. **Cost-Effectiveness:** AI-powered translations drastically reduce the cost of language services, especially for businesses that need to process large volumes of content. Hiring a team of human translators for such tasks would be far more expensive.

5. **Automated Multimodal Capabilities:** AI doesn't just handle written text—tools like Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech (such as Microsoft's Translator and Google's Speech Recognition) allow real-time spoken language translation, breaking down barriers in conversations between people who don’t share a common language.

## Limitations of NMT and AI:

1. **Lack of Cultural and Contextual Understanding:** While NMT systems are fast, they often lack the deep cultural understanding that human translators bring. AI can translate the words, but it struggles with context, tone, and regional variations in meaning, leading to awkward or incorrect translations.

2. **Inconsistent Accuracy with Complex Texts:** For straightforward, literal translations, NMT works well. However, when it comes to complex, nuanced, or highly specialized content, like legal documents or literary works, the accuracy drops significantly. AI still has a long way to go in capturing subtle meanings or implied tones.

3. **Over-Reliance on Training Data:** AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. If the training data lacks diversity or contains biases, the translations will reflect that. This can lead to misinterpretations or biased outputs in certain language pairs.

4. **Inability to Translate Emotion and Intent:** AI can’t truly grasp human emotions or intent behind words. Sarcasm, humor, and idiomatic phrases often get lost in translation. While AI can process the literal meaning, it misses out on the subtleties that a human translator or interpreter would catch instantly.

5. **Human Expertise Still Needed for High-Stakes Language tasks:** For legal, medical, or diplomatic translations where precision is crucial, human oversight remains irreplaceable. NMT can help speed up the process, but final revisions and interpretations should always be in the hands of skilled professionals.

6. **Career Growth:** Some employees may feel that working remotely limits their opportunities for career advancement, as they may have less visibility within the organization.

In short, while NMT and AI have brought tremendous improvements to the field of language tasks, there are still limitations that only human expertise can overcome. It’s about finding the right balance between using AI for efficiency and knowing when human intervention is needed. Despite all these technological advancements, there is still a bright future for language studies and experts. As AI continues to evolve, language professionals will remain crucial not only for tasks that require human understanding and nuance but also for roles in guiding, training, and improving these systems. Their expertise will continue to shape how language is used and understood in an increasingly interconnected and digital world.

Additionally, many new studies are combining language and technology to explore how to better use these systems and even train them for improved accuracy and performance. Language specialists are also diversifying their expertise, branching into fields like marketing, sales, and technology. Their linguistic skills, coupled with deep multilingual and multicultural knowledge, make them invaluable in industries beyond translation—this is a path I’ve personally taken as well. By leveraging my language background, I’ve ventured into areas like marketing, applying my skills in new and rewarding ways.
